# ArPipe Framework

ArPipe is objective extension of [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) framework inspired by [ARUCO](http://www.uco.es/investiga/grupos/ava/node/26) framework. Main purpose of framework is to provide simple object interface on OpenCV functions for beginners and prepare layout and templates for AR and computer vision applications for advanced developers.

----------
## Requirements

Framework is using OpenCV2 library. For running applications based on ArPipe framework, environment that can run C++ applications.

- C++ platform
- OpenCV library

## Introduction

Main idea of framework is based on connecting image processing blocks (Pipes) into PipeLines, which creates tree structure. Each Pipes uses OpenCV functions for processing image.
